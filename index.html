    <h1>Calin Segarceanu</h1>
    <p>I am Calin Segarceanu. I was born and raised in Romania. I lived my entire in the capital of Romania. Back in the 40s it used the be called the Small Paris. In Bucharest, I went to a high school that heavily emphasized classes in mathematics and computer science.

      That's why when time came to apply for college I chose to study computer science as my main major. The large number of jobs in this field also weighted in my decision. Right now I'm reluctant between a co-terminal in applied mathematics or computer science.

        Over the summer I worked for a medical startup, however I feel that in the future I'd like to work more with numbers, maybe in the finance or insurance industry. This is would be the main reason of doing a master in applied mathematics.

        For this semester I'm planning to do well in all of my class, and I'm planning to work hard for all of them. Since I wanted to take a humanities class that I'd feel that would be useful in the long term, I decided to enroll in this class. I've never learned about mobile responsive design and I feel that Professor Stolley will make me understand it.

        In my free time I enjoy going out, coding, exploring new cultures, our catching up with the last entrepreneurial success stories in the technical field. Right now I'm reading about ICO stories.
